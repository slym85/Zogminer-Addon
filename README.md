# Zogminer-Addon
Autostart.sh

This little script is intended to sun 2 instance per GPU of Zogminer 

I run it on Ubuntu 15.10 with no issues 

Prereq : typescript moreutils screen

Put the scrip in Zogminer folder and run it after editing your wallet, POOL, GPU number, donation preferences ( default is ON ! )  and "MAXTIME"

Improvment CLI will be added asap.

Njoy !
